Hi, I’m Xijia Polina Zhang, a first year Ph.D. student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I’m currently interested in how reasoning capabilities such as latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can enhance vision-language-action (VLA) models, and whether embodied reasoning traces can be meaningfully interfered, interpreted, or aligned. I’m also actively involved in work on explainable AI, human robot interaction, and reinforcement learning.

I publish under the name Zhang Xi-Jia, similar to the convention followed by {{< staticref "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fei-Fei_Li" "newtab" >}}Li Fei-Fei{{< /staticref >}}. In many Asian cultures, surnames are common and not reliable as personal identifiers. My surname Zhang, for example, is shared by over 100 million people worldwide.
